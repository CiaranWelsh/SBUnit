Installing
==========

SBunit is not available on pip: it is too early days for that. Instead you
should clone the sources:

```
git clone https://github.com/CiaranWelsh/SBUnit.git
cd SBUnit
```

And run `setup.py`

```
python setup.py install
```

This will install SBUnit into the `site-packages` directory of the currently active
Python environment.
