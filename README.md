SBUnit
------

A prototype for unit testing in systems biology. 

Docs are built but not live. Open "docs/index.html" locally. 


Installing
==========

SBunit is not available on pip: it is too early days for that. Instead you
should clone the sources:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/CiaranWelsh/SBUnit.git
   cd SBUnit

And run `setup.py`

.. code-block:: bash

   python setup.py install

This will install SBUnit into the `site-packages` directory of the currently active
Python environment.
